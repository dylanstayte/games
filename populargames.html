      It's hard to really say what the most popular games really are. You could look at statistics, and you would usually get Tetris and Minecraft as the top two most sold games. Well, Tetris used to be the number one spot, but now it goes like this.
        <ul>
          <li>Minecraft</li>
          <li>Grand Theft Auto 5</li>
          <li>Tetris</li>
        </ul>

        Now, the best selling game franchises go as followed.
        <ul>
          <li>Mario</li>
          <li>Tetris</li>
          <li>Pokemon</li>
        </ul>

        I don't think looking at the best sellers is the way to determine the most popular games. I personally don't think there were ever really be a most popular game, since everyone always has different opinions. The most popular games title is just subjective.
